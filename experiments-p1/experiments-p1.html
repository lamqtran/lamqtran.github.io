  <h2>Calibration Curve</h2>
  <p>The objective of the experiment was to design two different experiments for the development and analysis of calibration curves. The first experiment calibrated the rotameter for water flow rate (volume/time) versus setting. The second experiment calibrated the UV/Vis spectrophotometer at 620nm for yeast concentration (g/L) versus absorbance.</p>

  <h2>Fluidized Beds</h2>
  <p>The objective of the experiment was to determine the properties of a fluidized bed. The first part of the experiment varied air flow rate of the fluidized bed unit and record various parameters to determine the relationship between superficial velocity, pressure drop, and bed height. The second part varied air flow rate and heater height to determine their effect of the heat transfer coefficient.</p>

  <h2>Filmwise/Dropwise Condensation</h2>
  <p>The objective of the experiment was to compare the heat transfer between dropwise and filmwise condensers. For the experiment, a condenser unit was filled with 30mm of distilled water and vacuumed of air. The heating element evaporated the water to steam, which would condense on the surface of the condenser. Factors varied were steam temperature and cooling water flow rate. Heat flux and heat transfer coefficient were calculated for comparison between the condensers.</p>
