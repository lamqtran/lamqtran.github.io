  <h2>Alginate Diffusion</h2>
  <p>The objective of this experiment was to estimate the diffusivity of a solute polyethylene glycol (PEG) through an alginate bead membrane. Observations were made as data was collected on the diffusion concentrations at different time intervals. The data was then used to create a non-linear regression curve towards both diffusion in and out of the beads.</p>

  <h2>Gas Separation Membrane</h2>
  <p>The objective of the experiment was to characterize the performance of the membrane separation unit. For the experiment, feed air entered the unit and separated into a retentate stream and permeate stream. Three factors (system pressure, stage cut, and flow configuration) were varied while different parameters characterizing the performance were measured and calculated. The primary goal was to have low retentate oxygen concentration.</p>

  <h2>ONPG Reaction</h2>
  <p>The objective of the experiment was to determine the Michaelis-Menten constant and the maximum reaction velocity of the ONPG to ONP reaction. For the experiment, a calibration curve for ONP was produced comparing concentration to absorbance. ONPG solutions with molarities of 2.00, 1.00, 0.80, 0.50, 0.25, and 0.10 mM were tested for their reaction velocities. After collecting data, Matlab was used to determine the best-fit Km and Vmax values, which were compared to literature values. </p>
